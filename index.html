				<h2 class="display-5 fw-bold">About Us</h2>
				<p class="lead">After dedicating 25 years to the Waste and Recycling industry, my journey has been nothing short of transformative. I began my career as a refuse collector, a role that allowed me to understand the foundational aspects of waste management. Over the years, I progressed to senior management positions, overseeing Municipal services, Street services,  managing a Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) plant and a mattress recycling facility. <br> This extensive experience has equipped me with a deep understanding of the industry's intricacies and challenges.</p>
				<p class="lead">It was this journey, filled with learning and growth, that inspired me to establish Denviro Environmental Services Ltd. I wanted to share my knowledge and provide expert advice to an industry I have always been passionate about. Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to work in various capacities, which has given me a comprehensive view of the environmental sector. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 offset-md-1 h-100 d-flex flex-column justify-content-center">
				<p class="lead">As a qualified Chartered Institution of Wastes Management (CIWM) and Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) trainer assessor, I have had the privilege of training and mentoring others, which has been incredibly rewarding. This experience has reinforced my belief in the importance of compliance, safety, and sustainability in waste management.</p>
				<p class="lead">By starting Denviro Environmental Services Ltd, I aim to offer consultancy services that help businesses navigate these critical areas, ensuring they operate efficiently and responsibly. My passion for the environment and commitment to improving industry standards have been the driving forces behind this venture. I believe that every business, regardless of its size or sector, can benefit from expert guidance in environmental consultancy, permitting, compliance, and health and safety audits. At Denviro Environmental Services Ltd, we are dedicated to providing tailored solutions that meet the unique needs of each client. By doing so, we not only help businesses thrive but also contribute to a more sustainable future.</p>
